NoteTracker


Selecting the best product or service is some times a challenging task. As we usually face with different opinion and feedback from the users who have already had the experience. Some times different opinions are a result of different expectations. However, in some cases, users are provided with different products or services at a different time. The goal of NoteTracker is to provide an exploratory tool for both users and business holders, to not only being able to track the quality of the service or the product within the time but also being informed by the impact of each factor in changing the quality of product or service in the specific time period. We applied this product to track the quality of service of a sample hotel and we call it HotelWatch. 

In HotelWatch we provide the temporal trend of customer reviews that can address the pros and cons of the different topics more accurately and in a time-based manner. Use Case : Provide the customers with a better tool to track the trend of the hotels' ratings over time and have a better vision to select the best hotel during their stay. Business Case: Help the hotel company, to detect the anomaly in a real-time with the exact reason.
